This dataset combines low cost sensor data from Smart Citizen Kit, Meteotracker and Acronet.
"Particulate Matter (10\xB5m)":
  description: The mass concentration of fine particulate matter (particles with a
    diameter of 10 micrometers or less) present in the ambient air. Values are derived
    from a mixture of data from low cost sensors and and the CAMHS Air Quality Forecast.
  units: "\xB5g m^-3"
"Particulate Matter (2.5\xB5m)":
  description: The mass concentration of fine particulate matter (particles with a
    diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less) present in the ambient air. Values are derived
    from a mixture of data from low cost sensors and and the CAMHS Air Quality Forecast.
  units: "\xB5g m^-3"
