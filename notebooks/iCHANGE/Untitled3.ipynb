    "So the setup is this: Imagine we draw a very short line vector $\\vec{v}$ and let it flow along in a fluid with velocity field $u(\\vec{x}, t)$. Three things will happen, the vector will be translated along, it will possible change length and it will possibly change direction. If we ignoree the translation, we can ask what the equation would be for the change in length and direction of $\\vec{v}$. I'll drop the vector symbold on $v$, $u$ and $x$ from now on.\n",
