# Using iot-ingester with sensor.community data

1. Use `1_download_sensor_community.ipynb` to download some sensor.community monthly csv files. You can also do this manually.
2. Open and run `2_examine_with_iot_ingestor.ipynb` to see how iot-ingester treats it

The config yaml files are in `./config` and the data is in `./data`

I've tried to strip everything out of the config files that doesn't relate directly to sensor.community.
