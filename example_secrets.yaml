# This is an example for the expected format of secrets.yaml
# Do not put anything secret in here because if you accidentally commit it to Github
# those credentials will be compromised. Copy this to secrets.yaml and edit it,
# secrets.yaml is in the .gitignore so is more difficult to accidentally commit.
