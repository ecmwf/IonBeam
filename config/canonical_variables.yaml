# This file will contain a list of our canonical variables various metadata associated with them

# This is our canonical name for each variable
# Where possible I have used the same keys as defined by the WMO, see WMO_variables.yaml
# When that's not possible we need to define the key, unit and definition
# Possibly other variables too

# for dtype use object aliases from https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/basics.html#basics-dtypes
# default dtype is float64
